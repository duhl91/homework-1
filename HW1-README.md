### HTML & CSS Code Refactor

-The User Story requested the following:
    
    "As marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines."

In order to improve accessibility, image tags were added to all images and these, as well as the links, were tested to ensure functionality. 

In order to meet the Acceptance Criteria: 
- Both the CSS and HTML codes were cleaned up and made generally more easy to read and follow. 
- Redundant class tags were removed and consolidated. 
- The structure of the elements (and their CSS properties) were put in order. 
- Comments were added to the CSS and HTML pages.


> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
